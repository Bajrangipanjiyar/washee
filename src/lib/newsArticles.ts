      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">A Small Habit, a Big Return: Washee and Your Car's Resale Value</h2>
      <p>When you decide to sell your car, you want to get the best possible price. While mechanical condition is crucial, the first thing a potential buyer notices is the car's appearance. A clean, well-maintained vehicle not only makes a better first impression but can actually command a higher resale price.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Using Washee's regular services is one of the simplest and most effective ways to maintain and enhance your car's value. Here's how:</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">1. Paint Protection</h3>
      <p>Your car's paint isn't just cosmetic; it protects the underlying metal from rust and the elements. Dust, bird droppings, tree sap, and road grime contain acidic elements that can eat away at the paint's clear coat over time.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Regular Washing:</strong> Washee's regular washes remove these harmful contaminants before they can cause permanent damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Products:</strong> We use pH-balanced shampoos that are gentle on the paint, protecting it from fading or dulling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">A car with a glossy, well-protected paint job will always be more valuable than one with faded, stained paint.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">2. A Spotless Interior</h3>
      <p>The interior is where the driver and passengers spend their time. Stained seats, dirty carpets, and dusty dashboards signal that the car hasn't been properly cared for.</p>
       <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Deep Cleaning:</strong> Our regular interior cleaning and vacuuming prevent dirt from becoming ingrained.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Care:</strong> Our premium plans include dashboard polishing, which protects plastic and vinyl from cracking and fading, keeping the interior looking new.</li>
        <li><strong>Odor Removal:</strong> A clean interior also means a fresh-smelling interior, a major plus for buyers.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">3. Attention to Detail</h3>
      <p>We pay attention to the little things that buyers notice. Clean tires and rims, spotless windows, and clean door jambs all add up to present a picture of a car that has been well cared for. This gives the buyer confidence that the parts of the car they can't see have also been maintained.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Investing in a Washee monthly subscription isn't just about convenience; it's a smart investment in your asset. By spending a small amount on regular professional cleaning, you can protect and increase your car's resale value by thousands. It's one of the simplest ways to ensure your car holds its value for years to come.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Washee's Deep Seat Cleaning and Shampooing Services</h2>
      <p>Over time, car seats absorb dust, dirt, food stains, and sweat, making them look grimy and unhygienic. A standard vacuum can only remove surface-level dirt. This is where professional seat shampooing comes in.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">Yes, We Offer Seat Shampooing!</h3>
      <p>We are excited to announce that Washee now offers <strong>expert car seat shampooing</strong> as an add-on service. This service is not part of our regular wash packages but can be combined with any wash to give your car's interior a complete makeover.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">What Does Our Seat Shampooing Process Involve?</h3>
      <p>Our deep cleaning process is designed to remove the most stubborn dirt and stains from your seats:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Thorough Vacuuming:</strong> We start by thoroughly vacuuming the seats to remove any loose dirt and debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Treatment:</strong> We apply a special pre-treatment solution to heavily stained areas to loosen the stains.</li>
        <li><strong>Foam Application:</strong> We use a high-quality, fabric-safe shampoo that is applied as a foam to dissolve dirt without soaking the fabric.</li>
        <li><strong>Brushing and Agitation:</strong> Our team gently scrubs the fabric with soft brushes to completely remove the dirt.</li>
        <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> We use a powerful wet-and-dry vacuum (extractor) that pulls out the shampoo, dirt, and most of the moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Drying:</strong> While the extractor removes most of the water, the seats may take a few hours to dry completely. We recommend servicing in a well-ventilated area.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6 mb-3">Benefits of Seat Shampooing</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li>Removes stubborn stains (tea, coffee, oil, etc.).</li>
        <li>Eliminates odors.</li>
        <li>Removes allergy-causing dust mites and bacteria.</li>
        <li>Restores the original color and texture of your car's interior.</li>
        <li>Increases your car's resale value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-6">To add this service to your next car wash, please mention it in the notes during booking or contact our customer support team.</p>
